# SearXNG MCP Server

A template implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integrated with [SearXNG](https://github.com/searxng/searxng) for providing AI agents with powerful, privacy-respecting search capabilities.

Use this as a reference point to build your own MCP servers, or give this as an example to an AI coding assistant and tell it to follow this example for structure and code correctness!

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an MCP server that enables AI agents to perform web searches using a SearXNG instance. It serves as a practical template for creating your own MCP servers, using SearXNG as a backend.

The implementation follows the best practices laid out by Anthropic for building MCP servers, allowing seamless integration with any MCP-compatible client.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Access to a running SearXNG instance (local or remote)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (optional, for fast Python dependency management)

### SearXNG Server (Required)

You must have a SearXNG server running and accessible. The recommended way is via Docker:

```bash
docker run -d --name=searxng -p 32768:8080 -v "/root/searxng:/etc/searxng" \
  -e "BASE_URL=http://0.0.0.0:32768/" \
  -e "INSTANCE_NAME=home" \
  --restart always searxng/searxng
```

- This will run SearXNG on port 32768 and persist configuration in `/root/searxng`.
- The MCP server expects SearXNG to be available at `http://172.17.0.1:32768` by default (see `.env`).

---

## Installation

### Using uv

Install uv if you don't have it:

```bash
pip install uv
```

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/The-AI-Workshops/searxng-mcp-server.git
cd searxng-mcp-server/dev/searXNG-mcp
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file based on the provided example:

```bash
cp .env .env.local
# Edit .env.local as needed
```

Configure your environment variables in the `.env` file (see Configuration section).

---

### Using Docker (Recommended)

Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t mcp/searxng-mcp .
```

Create a `.env` file and configure your environment variables.

---

## Configuration

The following environment variables can be configured in your `.env` file:

| Variable           | Description                                 | Example                                 |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| SEARXNG_BASE_URL   | Base URL of your SearXNG instance           | http://172.17.0.1:32768                 |
| HOST               | Host to bind to when using SSE transport    | 0.0.0.0                                 |
| PORT               | Port to listen on when using SSE transport  | 32769                                   |
| TRANSPORT          | Transport protocol (sse or stdio)           | sse                                     |

---

## Running the Server

### Using uv

**SSE Transport**

Set `TRANSPORT=sse` in `.env` then:

```bash
uv run dev/searXNG-mcp/server.py
```

**Stdio Transport**

With stdio, the MCP client itself can spin up the MCP server, so nothing to run at this point.

---

### Using Docker

**SSE Transport**

```bash
docker build -t mcp/searxng-mcp .
docker run --rm -it -p 32769:32769 --env-file dev/searXNG-mcp/.env -v $(pwd)/dev/searXNG-mcp:/app mcp/searxng-mcp
```

- The `-v $(pwd)/dev/searXNG-mcp:/app` mount allows you to live-edit the code and .env file on your host and have changes reflected in the running container.
- The server will be available at `http://localhost:32769/sse`.

**Stdio Transport**

With stdio, the MCP client itself can spin up the MCP server container, so nothing to run at this point.

---

## Integration with MCP Clients

### SSE Configuration

Once you have the server running with SSE transport, you can connect to it using this configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "searxng": {
      "transport": "sse",
      "url": "http://localhost:32769/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

**Note for Windsurf users:** Use `serverUrl` instead of `url` in your configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "searxng": {
      "transport": "sse",
      "serverUrl": "http://localhost:32769/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

**Note for n8n users:** Use `host.docker.internal` instead of `localhost` since n8n has to reach outside of its own container to the host machine:

So the full URL in the MCP node would be: `http://host.docker.internal:32769/sse`

Make sure to update the port if you are using a value other than the default 32769.

---

### Python with Stdio Configuration

Add this server to your MCP configuration for Claude Desktop, Windsurf, or any other MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "searxng": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["dev/searXNG-mcp/server.py"],
      "env": {
        "TRANSPORT": "stdio",
        "SEARXNG_BASE_URL": "http://172.17.0.1:32768",
        "HOST": "0.0.0.0",
        "PORT": "32769"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Docker with Stdio Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "searxng": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "--rm", "-i",
               "-e", "TRANSPORT",
               "-e", "SEARXNG_BASE_URL",
               "-e", "HOST",
               "-e", "PORT",
               "mcp/searxng-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "TRANSPORT": "stdio",
        "SEARXNG_BASE_URL": "http://172.17.0.1:32768",
        "HOST": "0.0.0.0",
        "PORT": "32769"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Building Your Own Server

This template provides a foundation for building more complex MCP servers. To build your own:

- Add your own tools by creating methods with the `@mcp.tool()` decorator
- Create your own lifespan function to add your own dependencies (clients, database connections, etc.)
- Add prompts and resources as well with `@mcp.resource()` and `@mcp.prompt()`

---
